Overview

Simple Save is an editor extenstion and runtime system 
that allows users to create data sets within a database 
and save/load them as binary or xml to and from a custom 
path in editor or at runtime. 

Simple Save is designed to be light weight and non 
instrusive, thus is very basic in its application and use. 
The system can save (serialize) non monobehaviour classes, 
when used with the Simple Save manager window the user can 
only assign int, float and strings to properties, but those 
who have the confidence can access the functions directly 
through code to save and load more complex non monobehaviour 
classes that contain arrays and serializable .net objects. 

Simple Save is perfect for saving data like player score, 
level and experience, or storing references to an internal 
asset database. You can even create an entire database of 
items with their statistics that you can save as xml and 
update outside of runtime and load back in to update changes, 
when used in conjuction with asset bundles could provide a 
simple solution to patching your game at build.
