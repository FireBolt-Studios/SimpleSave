Advanced (Script)

Simple Save is built around a simple set methods that can serialize and deserialize
.net classes. Theses methods can load and save bianry and xml files, they are static
also allowing you to call them from any monobehviour script without reference while
using SimpleSave.Core in your scripts. 

The database, settings and options provided with this package are optional and are
designed for novice scripters to interface this system. The file settings and runtime
options are not required since you can write your own systems to work alongside this. 

All of Simple Save scripts are kept within its own namespace, with runtime classes 
extending to core and editor scripts to editor. Example, if you want to access the 
GetProperty method, you would include "Using SimpleSave.Core" in your script and
call the method using DataUtility.GetProperty() where DataUtility is the script that
contains multiple static methods for getting and setting properties and data.

There is already a data and property class included with this package, but I will
remind you that this can save and load any .net classes that are serializable.
The data class contains two fields, a string for the datas name and list of properties,
another custom class that contains two fields, a string for the propery name and an 
object field for primitive data types like int, float and string. Data is stored within 
a list in the database. 

If your confident in your sctipting ability you can cut away everything in this package
and use just the Serialize class in your projects, this is the back bone and primary
feature of simple save. With the serialize class you can save your non-mono classes 
directly and easily. Look up the commands for doing this in the script reference within
this help window.
